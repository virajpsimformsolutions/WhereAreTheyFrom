# Where Are They From? 

The final app from the Udacity iOS Nanodegree curriculum was a design and build your own idea capstone project.

<a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2015/10/more-apps-our-students-are-launching.html">Feature on the Udacity Blog</a>

The app was designed to develop iOS skills including:
- UIKit
- Core Data
- NSFetchController
- NSURLSession
- JSON Parsing
- MKMapViews
- Design, Development and Testing Phases

This is an app that lets you search for an actor and find out where they are from. Start by tapping the "plus" icon on the upper right hand corner of the map scene. Use the search bar to search TheMovieDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/ ~ Thank you Travis) for your favorite actors. Click the name of the actor you wish to find out about from the list. If successful, the app will locate the hometown of the actor and place a pin at that location. By clicking the pin and the information button on the annotation view, you can get a short description of the actor from Wikipedia. To delete pins, use the edit button on the top left of the map screen. In the edit mode simply tap on pins to delete them.
