Where Are They From? is an app that lets you search for an actor and
find out where in the world they are from!

Start by tapping the "plus" icon on the upper right hand corner of the
map scene. Use the search bar to seach TheMovieDB for your fav actors.
Click the name of the actor you wish to find out about from the list.
If succesful, the app will locate the hometown of the actor and place 
a pin at that location! By clicking the pin and the information button
on the annotation view that pops up you can get a short description of 
the actor from wikipedia. To delete pins, use the edit button on the 
top left of the map screen. In the edid mode simply tap on pins to
delete them.
